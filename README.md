## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User sees loading state while waiting for the API.

## Notes

I faced challenge in bringing up the animation in the details page. I tried various ways: Using Scroll event handler, Gesture event handler. At last settled with Gesture event handlers. I am not sure if it is the right way to do so. There might be other cleaner ways to do so as well.

I faced some more challenges on customizing the tableView. 
- There were separator inlets which was making the view look bad. 
- There were separator lines coming for the empty cells
- UIsearch bar (X) image on the search bar doesnot trigger the cancel event. I had to put an explicit cancel button.
